# Getting Started
## With Docker

Run docker compose:
```sh
docker-compose up
```

If the run failed with postgres container, run:

```sh
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --force-recreate
```

The next time, just run docker compose normally

If you add changes, run the following command so that docker can take them into account :

```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

Then, the node server will run on localhost:3000 and the postgres on localhost:5432

## Without Docker

You have to install [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org) locally.

Then you have to create an admin and a database :

```sh
psql -U postgres
```

```postgres
CREATE DATABASE auth;
CREATE ROLE auth_admin password 'auth' login;
GRANT ALL ON DATABASE auth TO auth_admin WITH GRANT OPTION;
```

You can access to you database with your admin role like this:

```bash
psql -U auth_admin auth
```

Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)


Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Set environment (vars):

```sh
cp env.example .env
```

Start server:

```sh
npm start
```

The server will start on localhost:3000
